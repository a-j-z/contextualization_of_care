                HPI: Lilly is a 5 year old girl with insulin dependent diabetes (IDDM) for 2 years. Although previously well controlled, she has had several episodes of hyperglycemia over the last four months.
                <br><br>
                She is brought to the appointment by her grandmother. This is a follow up appointment, as the patient was actually seen a week earlier for the same concern, and was brought in that time by her mother. At that visit the mother had reported no changes in diet. She eats three meals per day. Since mom is single and has worked since Lilly was seven months of age, Lilly is supervised by her grandmother several days each week while mom works. 
                <br><br>
                Both mom and grandma are trained to give 7 units of insulin glargine at bedtime, and two doses of lispro utilizing an insulin:carbohydrate (I:C)* ratio of 40 and a correction factor (CF) of 50 for finger stick glucose readings above 130 (CF** 50>130).
                <br><br>
                At last weekâ€™s appointment, after confirming that the mom is aware of dosages and gives them consistently, the pediatrician increased the insulin glargine to 9 units.
